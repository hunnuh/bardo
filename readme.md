  Bardo won 1st place in Games at the 2017 CSUN Multimedia Showcase.

  Bardo the Savior is a 10-20 minute original point-and-click adventure game. Modelled after classic Humongous Entertainment inc. games such as Pajama Sam and Freddi Fish, Bardo moves the format into a new era with a completely browser-based form factor.

  This was one of my first major JavaScript programming projects. With hindsight, it was incredibly ambitious and took me from beginner to intermediate quicker than any online course did. Bardo includes three seperate puzzles, a dynamic event scripting system, custom sprite-based animation, a dynamic dialogue system, and a custom inventory system. I also wrote my own photoshop script to take animations and spread them out into enormous sprite sheets.
